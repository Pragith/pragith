On my 1st participation in any of the competition held in college, in my 1st ever "Fest", me and friend stood 1st, crossing all our seniors who were from 4th, 6th and 8th semester.

The competition was, <strong>Technical Paper Presentation</strong>, where we had to bark on a particular topic. The topic we chose was <strong>Web 2.0. </strong>After we completed our presentation, it was our Question/Answer time with the judges. One of the judge said, "First let me say that this is the best presentation I have ever seen so far."

Then, the rest of the Q/A went fine. After we came out, we were like, what the hell did we speak, we couldn't even re-collect that. It was on-the-spot. We didn't cram/by-heart anything, and ofcourse were nervous, but had this much confidence that whatever was present in the slide, we had full knowledge of it.

After 4-5 hours, my friend came and told me that we came 1st

beating around 5-6 seniors (don't know exactly though). We didn't have any equal aged participants.

1st Prize was certificate along with a cash prize of Rs.4500. So, me and my friend divided the loot :P, and I came back with Rs.2250 and a certificate, which I can't control my eyes from staring at.
