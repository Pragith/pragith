Sunday, 17<sup>th</sup> Feb. 2008, is now registered as the 1<sup>st</sup> tour of our ISE batch's small gang. Arranged by my friends, Malyadri, Jugal &amp; Amogh, for our friends, (well, it's a long list, so I better not name all) went to a place near Sri Rangapatna, named Balmuri Falls (Damn! The names of the places in Karnataka just don't get into my mind and mouth). I don't want to churn your bandwidth, so I have uploaded the photos in my <a href="http://album.pragith.net/">Picasa Web Album</a>.

We gathered at some 6:45 am in HAL's (Airport) Bus Stop in Bangalore. Then we set sail (well, not exactly sail) to the *ahem* earlier mentioned place. On the way, we played (sort of), dumb charades and sung songs (my newly learnt "Pettai Rap" song from the not-so old movie Kadhalan, earned me a good round of applause). In a couple+1 (does that make triple?) hours, we had to fill our tanks (Read – Stomach), so went in to a sort of sophisticated dhaba. I ordered 2 Idli (does idli have a plural form?), and 2 vada (i). After filling our tanks and burping loudly, we resumed our journey.

Finally, we reached our destination, and were slightly disappointed because as the name says, "Falls", we couldn't see any water fall, except water continuously falling from a height of 10 feet.<!--more--> Anyways, we spent some 2 hours in the water, as usual playing what everyone plays, then collected few stones and "black colored" shells as a souvenir.

After bathing again (Read – Playing in the water), we went to Late Mr. Tipu Sultan's Summer Palace in Mysore. We spent an hour inside the palace museum and in the garden.

Then, we went to a place named "Sangam", where 2 to 3 rivers meet at a point. One of them being Cauvery, the other one, I don't remember :P

At around 6:30pm, we took a turn towards Bangalore. My throat was completely damaged (yeah, poor me), so couldn't speak much (as I occasionally do). Reached Bangalore by 9pm and everyone dispatched except me and my friend who stayed near to my house. We waited for the exact bus to come, and we stuffed ourselves into the already bursting bus. Till I reached my stop, my hands were somewhere, my legs were somewhere else, and my torso bent into a unique position which whenever I think about, gets me into pain.

Of course, I was really tired, with my eyes completely red, as if one couldn't distinguish between my Iris (the black part) and Sclera (the white part), clearly pointing me to go and fall flat on my bed. But, na, how can I forget to take a bath to get rid of the contamination which I have got from the water (fall) and the suffocating bus. Later, I checked my mails, and allowed my body to go into the mystifying stage(sleep).
