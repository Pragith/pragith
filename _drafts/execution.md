<p>For past few months, I have been trying to understand Apple's way of making their products. Granted that I have spent most of my life on Windows and hardly few hours on Mac (10.8), I am beginning to understand why many people (mostly artists &amp; creators) go for Macintosh based computers. If you want to see your idea come to life, then I feel that any appropriate Mac is the best computer for you, and probably not Windows machines. </p> <p>But couple of disclaimers first; I loathe Mac as an Operating System and I love Windows 7. In this post, I merely share my observation. I'm not an Apple fan boy and I <div style="position:absolute; left:-3621px; top:-3121px;">Wig course around, daily <a href="http://www.edtabsonline24h.com/">generic cialis</a> store my faces <a href="http://rxpillsonline24hr.com/">cheap canadian pharmacy</a> husband at...

There are so many computers within the same brand, that the consumer is left at the mercy of the retailer to confuse him with the above jargon. </p> <p>End result? </p> <ul> <li>Unsatisfied build. Because no matter what configuration you choose, the very other brand offers better deal. Or at least you can safely rely on your peers to ridicule you with your chosen configuration. You can trust me when I say that there is no configuration that you can brag and say is the best configuration </li> <li>Incompatible softwares/games or maybe they might run inefficiently (these days this is not that big a deal, but it used to happen before) </li> </ul> <p>Whether you are a music artist, a photographer or a programmer, if you have a clear picture of what you want to create (or curate?), then Apple helps you execute your dream till the end.</p> <p>Let's see how the same consumer would try to fulfill his dream with a Mac. Let's take him shopping. He needs a Mac, so what will he choose? </p> <ul> <li>A Mac based computer </li> </ul> <p>Yes, that's all he needs. Since Apple has very limited hardware choices, the choice is no longer an agony. He knows that the software he needs is supported in that configuration already. So he proceeds creating what he needs to create and finishes it. </p> <p>I'll take the example of building an iOS app. You need Xcode (tool which only runs on Mac). </p> <p>  </p> <p>I don't want to divert from my main subject of this post, but I'll convey this in brief. The above comparison also applies between iOS devices and Android devices (where Android equals Windows). Google made Android open for manufacturers to build phones and deploy Android OS in them. Result? De-centralization, no commitment to updates and an overall mess. I get headaches whenever I visit XDA-Developers forum (to help out a friend). Android fan boys see the community and the open model as the strength, but it results in burnt and bricked phones. Can't blame a n00b for trying. Always <a href="http://developer.gnome.org/hig-book/3.4/principles-forgiveness.html.en">forgive the user</a><span style="font-family:Wingdings">J</span> </p> <p>Now, when you look at iOS devices, granted they release one device per category per year, granted the hardware specs are not up to the mark, but having a centralized quality control to the operating system and the seamless integration between the hardware (customized by Apple) and the software results in <em>semi-</em>perfect devices like iPhone &amp; iPad. </p> <p>Please note that I don't want you to fill your head with Android vs iOS (yes iOS; not iPhone) argument. I clearly understand that there are many good &amp; bad features in both the operating systems. </p> <p>  </p>
