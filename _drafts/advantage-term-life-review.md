b'"Advantage Term Life" provides the best term rates amongst its competitors. Both for Family and Couples, Advantage Term Life provides insurance to everyone across USA and from all major companies. [Fill in the form](http://www.advantagetermlife.com/) and with their unique online system called Advantage Term Quotes, you will see your costs getting lowered.\r\n\r\nOne of the unique and important policies I found from them was the [Key Man Rates](http://www.advantagetermlife.com/key.php) scheme. Even if one of your key/important employees (like CEOs, Presidents, Accountants, etc) were to expire, your business will stay protected. The main criteria behind this scheme were uninterrupted flow of the Business. The loss of such employees may result to extreme situations like Bankruptcy. So, in such cases, this coverage comes to rescue. I personally consider this worth purchasing.\r\n\r\nOne catchier Policy scheme from Advantage Term Life is the [Whole Life Policy Rates](http://www.advantagetermlife.com/whole.php), which provides coverage for your entire life. Though being a costly choice, this type of insurance never expires and also doesn\'t increase over time. This scheme would be specifically useful for those who no longer are dependent upon anyone. A specialty in this scheme is that you can cash out any time before any crisis. And moreover, this scheme can also be considered as a better form of investment. It\'s better to get a quote before commencing to this scheme.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting scheme is the [Employee Group Life Insurance](http://www.advantagetermlife.com/group_quotes.php) which claims to get coverage for 2 or more employees or owners of a firm along with a discount. This is particularly useful when each and every employee wants to get covered. With this scheme, the company can maintain their policies at a very cheap price in comparison with individual coverage of each employee. However, this scheme becomes invalid once the employer is out of contract from the company.'
