b'Hello readers,\r\n\r\nAfter installing Windows Vista Ultimate, is it possible to not to blog about it? Not fair na?! So here it is then. It took around \xc2\xbd hour to install the giant Microsoft OS. After that every second was superb. The look and feel of Aero, well, I might be the nth  person to talk about that. Though I had used Vista Transformation Pack on my XP before, so the Task Bar, Title Bar, etc. weren\'t new to me. The major difference was the Aero Effect and high amount of options offered by each and every feature. Though I am a Linux lover too, but I won\'t comment on the difference between the two (for the fights, check other forums :P ).\r\n\r\nFor me, Windows Vista literally means candy-to-the-eye. So the question now is, *"Will I ever switch-off the system?"* Of course yes, I can\'t continuously gaze on the addicting gliding of the windows and Flip 3D effects :P'
