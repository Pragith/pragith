I just came back from Innovative Multiplex, Bangalore after watching a Hindi movie named, "Welcome". Without any delay I would like to give my thoughts in just 2 words, <strong>"Pathetic Direction"</strong>. Except the small gags which are very famous among all of us, the rest of the movie was absolutely pathetic. I did ROFL at some of the scenes, but the story line and aw God! the length of the movie made me give it only 3/10 rating. As usual, the movie was over spent than required with exotic locations in UAE and the jaw dropping sets. I honestly don't know whether it's a hit or a flop. But, if it wouldn't have been the "top" actors we have in Bollywood, this movie would have definitely sunk.
My suggestion to you is that, it's better to keep the money in your wallet rather than spending it for this movie. In short, "Don't Go!"
