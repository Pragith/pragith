Discount Health Pack is a Medical based Insurance Company in USA. There are basically two types of packages, namely, <a href="http://www.discounthealthpack.com/Ameriplan_USA_Health_Package">Ameriplan Health Package</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.discounthealthpack.com/Ameriplan_USA_Dental_Package">Ameriplan USA Dental Package</a><strong>.</strong> Apart from these two packages, <a href="http://www.discounthealthpack.com/Basic_Health">Ameriplan Basic Health</a> and <a href="http://www.discounthealthpack.com/Total_Health">Ameriplan Total Health</a> are the packages which allow particular discounts. They are individually discussed below: -
<ul>
	<li>Ameriplan Basic Health package offers up to 50% of discount on Doctors, Specialist, and Diagnostic tests. You are bound to receive many ancillary services such as lab work, diabetic supplies, imaging centers, and so on and so forth. This package costs $29.95 per month only.</li>
	<li>Ameriplan Total Health is for each and everyone in a household. This package gets you all the options present in Basic Health, with extras like Dental, Vision, Prescription Drug, and Chiropractic programs. It costs $39.95 per month.</li>
</ul>
The Ameriplan Health Package as mentioned above is a plan which includes EVERYTHING! Around 400, physicians are available all over USA. To know about the physicians in your area, <a href="http://www.discounthealthpack.com/">enter your PIN CODE</a> and you will get the list of all available physicians. Being a customer of this plan will fetch you a whopping 50% discount on Medical Services (Read: Extras above). The catchy feature in this plan is that there are no deductibles, no limits on age and no limits on services. This package can also be considered as a better insurance system according to me.

The Ameriplan Dental Plan also has some very cool schemes. Namely, Ameriplan Discount Dental Plan, Ameriplan Vision Discount, Ameriplan Prescription Benefits, Ameriplan Chiropractic Discount. Each of these features has their own benefits. The Discount Dental Plan offers a discount of 59% on specialty procedures. The Vision Discount gives 60% discount on your eye-care. The Prescription Benefits saves 25% and 50% on brand name prescriptions and generic respectively. Lastly, the Chiropractic Discount can get you a free initial visit and consultation. And services like massage therapy are discounted by 30%.
