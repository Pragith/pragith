b'Thanks to Google Voice, now I own a US based phone number.\r\n\r\n**(816) 200-1626**\r\n\r\n\r\n##### *You can use this widget only if you own a US number. Once you put in your phone number, Google will call you and me at the same time, and will connect us.*

\r\nYou can call me, and if I am online on Gtalk, then I\'ll pick up your call and talk with you, otherwise you can record a sweet voicemail, which I would be checking on Google Voice\'s homepage. You can also leave texts.\r\n\r\nIf you stay in the US, then I won\'t be charged for outgoing calls from my side.\r\n\r\nPlease spam my number :)'
