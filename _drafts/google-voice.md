Thanks to Google Voice, now I own a US based phone number.

<h5><em>You can use this widget only if you own a US number. Once you put in your phone number, Google will call you and me at the same time, and will connect us.</em></h5>
You can call me, and if I am online on Gtalk, then I'll pick up your call and talk with you, otherwise you can record a sweet voicemail, which I would be checking on Google Voice's homepage. You can also leave texts.

If you stay in the US, then I won't be charged for outgoing calls from my side.

Please spam my number :)
