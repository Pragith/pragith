b'Lately, I had a checklist in my mind which I wanted to fulfill by purchasing them with the money I earn(ed) from paid reviews. Here it goes :-  
  
> Football  
> Counter Strike  
> Wrist-watch  
> Guitar  
  
Yeah, I have purchased a T-90 Strike Nike Football for Rs.850. Also, I bought Counter Strike v1.6 and Counter Strike : Condition Zero for $9.99 from Steam.  
Apart from that, I will be having my 2nd semester external exams in late June till mid of July.
