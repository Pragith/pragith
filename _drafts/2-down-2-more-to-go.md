<p>Lately, I had a checklist in my mind which I wanted to fulfill by purchasing them with the money I earn(ed) from paid reviews. Here it goes :-<br /><br />&gt; <span style="text-decoration:line-through">Football</span><br />&gt; <span style="text-decoration:line-through">Counter Strike</span><br />&gt; Wrist-watch<br />&gt; Guitar<br /><br />Yeah, I have purchased a T-90 Strike Nike Football for Rs.850. Also, I bought Counter Strike v1.6 and Counter Strike : Condition Zero for $9.99 from Steam.<br />Apart from that, I will be having my 2<sup>nd</sup> semester external exams in late June till mid of July.<br /><br /><img src="http://pragith.net/blog/wp-content/052208-0747-2down2more11.jpg" alt=""/></p>
