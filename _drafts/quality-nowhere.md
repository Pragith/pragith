b'This is very saddening to see that everyone knows the word Quality but many don\'t know the meaning of it.\r\n\r\nI recently came across many such people/organizations who are boasting about their quality service, but just delivering the opposite.\r\n\r\nThe major example of this case is the tech magazine named, "IC CHIP" which is very famous for its contents and forums. And I will tell you why I chose this magazine as an example below :-\r\n1st Issue :-

\r\nI subscribed to this magazine for 1 year after being an old subscriber 1 year back. My subscription started with October Issue. After getting the issue, that too late (around 12th or something, I faintly remember), I didn\'t receive the DVD. Naturally, being irritated I shouted at their forums for not giving the DVD. They told me to calm down and write a formal letter to their Customer Care. After apologising for being very harsh, I wrote a letter to them. I didn\'t know that Customer Care of Infomedia were so dumb and robotic. I got a very odd reply from them which even AI will laugh upon. Alright, no problem, they said that they will send the replacement asap. Their asap was so quick, that I received at around 25th or something. Wah! That too, the replacement disc was very dirty.

\r\n 

\r\n2nd Issue :-

\r\nThe november issue which I got, thank god, had the DVD. But, again it was stained and filled with lots of scratches. I snapped a photo of that disc and uploaded it and gave that link in their forums. Again after shouting at them, they (without any shame) said to write a formal letter to the Customer Care (CC). The reply from them frustrated me more. That woman just replaced the word "October" to "November" and sent me the same email. I know that they use a template kind of a thing to reply to such requests. But why I got angry was because I have also complained few issues to PCQuest and DIGIT, but their reply is so customized, that they write the mails on their own and even CC them to the concerned department. [If anyone wants a proof, just contact me, and I will forward you the mails from them. ]

\r\nThen came the time of replacement. After receiving the replacement discs for both Oct. and Nov. Issue, I noticed that, it was stained and scratched more than the previous one. Now, anyone at this point of time will not be very happy. Naturally, again I shouted at them. For which I got banned temporarily for using the line, Chip CC sucks, because I used an abusive word called, "suck". How dumb?! I checked everywhere on the Internet and even in T.V. when they shout this word, it doesn\'t get bleeped.

\r\nThis issue of giving scratched discs wasn\'t only for me, it was for few other subscribers too. After constantly flaming at their forums, these cheap people just renamed that particular section from "REVIEW IC CHIP" to "Website and DVD Content Feedback".

\r\n 

\r\n3rd Issue :-

\r\nThe competition for giving me more scratched discs was still on. This time, they gave me 2 out of 4 discs stained and missed giving the CT Racer Game Card (worth Rs.100). Upon shouting once more, they banned me permanently. I received a replacement of the whole magazine, out of which 2 or 3 discs were so damn stained and scratched, as if a dog has scratched it with its paws. I mailed the admin regarding this, and he was kind enough to send me the replacement of only the 4 discs. This time, please read this line carefully, the discs were stained but very less. So, they are manageable. The time of receiving the replacement for 3rd time, my 3 college friends were there with me. Without saying a word about what happened for so long with me, I just showed them the discs (since it was anniversary, I told them that very good contents are present). Out of my 3 friends, 1 of my friend said these words, "Macchaan, they are dirty da!" (Dude, they are dirty!).

\r\n 

\r\nConclusion :-

\r\nDear readers, as told by many of my friends including the admin(indirectly), I would like to suggest you to not to ever subscribe with CHIP. Purchase from the News Stands, but never ever subscribe it. Else, you will repent the quality given by them

\r\nNow since, I was satisfied with their current replacement of DVDs, I went to their forums for getting revenge for banning me. The admin constantly said that he banned me because I violated their rules by using a word which is against the forum rules AND not because I was against CHIP. I am constantly reminding him that others are also using it and not only me.

\r\n 

\r\nThe above facts made me realize that corrupt people and non-existence of the factor called Quality, does really exist.
