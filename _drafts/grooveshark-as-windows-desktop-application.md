Grooveshark is the best, free music streaming website on the Internet.
I've been using it for a while now, but keeping the Grooveshark tab open along with my other tabs is a bit cumbersome. So, here is a neat trick to separate Grooveshark from your browser, clearly I just use it for listening music, because when I use slower computers I can't watch videos without a decent graphic card, like the one in the <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.hotrate.com/electronics/best-graphics-cards/"><span style="text-decoration: none; color: #000000;">HotRate review guide here</span></a>, so in those cases I prefer limit myself just to music.

1) Open <a href="http://grooveshark.com" target="_blank">http://grooveshark.com</a> in Chrome
2) Go to "Tools" -> "Create Application Shortcuts"
3) With "Desktop" ticked, press "Create"

Grooveshark now appears like a windows application with its shortcut on the desktop.

 

You can use the same trick even for Tweetdeck (<a href="http://web.tweetdeck.com/" target="_blank">http://web.tweetdeck.com/</a>)
