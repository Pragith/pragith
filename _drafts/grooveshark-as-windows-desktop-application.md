b'Grooveshark is the best, free music streaming website on the Internet.\nI\'ve been using it for a while now, but keeping the Grooveshark tab open along with my other tabs is a bit cumbersome. So, here is a neat trick to separate Grooveshark from your browser, clearly I just use it for listening music, because when I use slower computers I can\'t watch videos without a decent graphic card, like the one in the [HotRate review guide here](https://www.hotrate.com/electronics/best-graphics-cards/), so in those cases I prefer limit myself just to music.\n\n1) Open <http://grooveshark.com> in Chrome\n2) Go to "Tools" -> "Create Application Shortcuts"\n3) With "Desktop" ticked, press "Create"\n\nGrooveshark now appears like a windows application with its shortcut on the desktop.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nYou can use the same trick even for Tweetdeck (<http://web.tweetdeck.com/>)'
