b'<sarcasm name="sore-loser" class="cheap">\r\n\r\nThis post will teach you how to win an argument or debate:\r\n\r\n\t* Mock the accent or sudden change of language from the debating language of the other person
\r\n\t* Correct grammar
\r\n\t* Use what I call "[Faraday\'s Right-hand rule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-hand_rule)". Blame God/Destiny (Thumb), blame the person in front of you (Index) & blame some random person who is either next to you or not present during the debate (Middle)
\r\n\t* Talk to some third person when the other person is talking, as if trying to ignore him/her
\r\n\t* Use proverbs/phrases which were probably made by losers (power-slam move)
\r\n\t* Walk out (finisher move)
\r\n\t* Get personal
\r\n\t* Change the topic
\r\n\t* Age/Experience (this one can only be used if you are significantly elder to the other person) (proven to work)
\r\n\r\n</sarcasm>'
