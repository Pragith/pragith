&lt;sarcasm name="sore-loser" class="cheap"&gt;

This post will teach you how to win an argument or debate:
<ul>
	<li>Mock the accent or sudden change of language from the debating language of the other person</li>
	<li>Correct grammar</li>
	<li>Use what I call "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-hand_rule" target="_blank">Faraday's Right-hand rule</a>". Blame God/Destiny (Thumb), blame the person in front of you (Index) &amp; blame some random person who is either next to you or not present during the debate (Middle)</li>
	<li>Talk to some third person when the other person is talking, as if trying to ignore him/her</li>
	<li>Use proverbs/phrases which were probably made by losers (power-slam move)</li>
	<li>Walk out (finisher move)</li>
	<li>Get personal</li>
	<li>Change the topic</li>
	<li>Age/Experience (this one can only be used if you are significantly elder to the other person) (proven to work)</li>
</ul>
&lt;/sarcasm&gt;
