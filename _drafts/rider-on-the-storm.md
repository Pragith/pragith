b'Wish the "storm" part was true. Scorching heat in Bangalore makes me compare it with the summer in Delhi. But atleast the "Rider" part makes me happy. I cleared my Driving License Test for 2-wheeler and 4-wheeler yesterday.\r\n\r\nI would say it was more like an Endurance Test, making us wait for our turns to come and show our NFS style driving and Dirt-Bike style riding skills. Yes, I am sarcastic on this part. They made us go few meters (without acceleration) in front, and few meters in reverse, and Bingo! I PASSED!\r\nFor Bike, they told us to go straight, take a left turn, and get lost!\r\n\r\nWant more updates on my private life, whom I am dating, etc?
