b'This is a very terrible vulnerability from Orkut/Gmail which works on the basis of cookie. If a person knows the password for either of the two, it\'s easy for him to get into the other one. An example here will make the issue clear.\r\n\r\nFor e.g. I have two different passwords for my Gmail and Orkut account. When I log in to Orkut account (Note: Remember password is ticked), then it stores a cookie into my computer, which means that I am automatically logged into my Gmail account. After logging in to my Orkut account, I just typed gmail.com and voila! I could see my Gmail Inbox on my screen (even though the passwords were entirely different).\r\n\r\nThe testing platform was Firefox, so if you guys are trying it with Internet Explorer, I can\'t guarantee that this will work or not.\r\n\r\nI hope Google checks this error and corrects it.\r\n\r\n\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\r\n\r\nNOTE: This article is written by me (Pragith), in case you want to post this issue on your website/blog, then don\'t forget to take prior permission from me before proceeding, else your website/blog content will be considered as Plagiarism.
