This is a very terrible vulnerability from Orkut/Gmail which works on the basis of cookie. If a person knows the password for either of the two, it's easy for him to get into the other one. An example here will make the issue clear.

For e.g. I have two different passwords for my Gmail and Orkut account. When I log in to Orkut account (Note: Remember password is ticked), then it stores a cookie into my computer, which means that I am automatically logged into my Gmail account. After logging in to my Orkut account, I just typed gmail.com and voila! I could see my Gmail Inbox on my screen (even though the passwords were entirely different).

The testing platform was Firefox, so if you guys are trying it with Internet Explorer, I can't guarantee that this will work or not.

I hope Google checks this error and corrects it.
