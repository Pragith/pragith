b'Was I pre-occupied or was I too lazy to update my blog? Ask my friends, and they will tell the latter because I didn\'t have anything to pre-occupy myself from blogging. Before jumping into the title, I would like to inform you what made me go away from my blog for such a long time.\n\nAnd here I present to you [Hackits.De](http://www.hackits.de/forum/profile.php?userid=24637). This website is filled with a variety of Crypts, CrackMe(s), Programming based challenges, and my favorite JavaScript challenges. Currently I am ranked 396 out of some 31,000 (Whew, I made it to the [Top 500](http://www.hackits.de/toplist.php))\n\nNow coming to the main point. I am in the 3rd Semester of my Engineering Course (senior??) and I don\'t know what the reason was for making me the Class Representative. Not that I hate doing this job, but there are few things I have to bear along with the special attention I am getting from all the teachers (Jeez, I love being in the limelight). I have become like a *dholak *- get hit from both the sides. Can\'t change the decision of the lecturer (to some extent) and as a result also disappoint few students. I was actually thinking of naming the title as, "Confessions of a CR", but I don\'t want to be like Pritam (Mr. Plagiarist).\n\n---To Be Updated---'
