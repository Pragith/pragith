b'Hello readers,\r\n\r\nI am writing this blog post with the help of a tool called Windows Live Writer. I must say that I found this tool much better than MS Word 2007. It has enormous features dedicated to blogs.\r\n\r\nWhile setting up my blog\'s configuration in this tool, it created a temporary blog post in order to detect the theme settings and other configuration.\r\n\r\nI really recommend this tool to my fellow bloggers and the newbies who wish to step into the world of blogging.\r\n\r\nGet it from [here](http://get.live.com/writer/overview).'
