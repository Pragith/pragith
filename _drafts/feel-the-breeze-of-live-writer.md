Hello readers,

I am writing this blog post with the help of a tool called Windows Live Writer. I must say that I found this tool much better than MS Word 2007. It has enormous features dedicated to blogs.

While setting up my blog's configuration in this tool, it created a temporary blog post in order to detect the theme settings and other configuration.

I really recommend this tool to my fellow bloggers and the newbies who wish to step into the world of blogging.

Get it from <a href="http://get.live.com/writer/overview" target="_blank">here</a>.
