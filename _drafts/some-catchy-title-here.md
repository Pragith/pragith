<div class="topContent"> <p>The beginning of the end of my first half of college life started on 5th Feb. For those who can’t compile that and are approaching the small “X” mark on the top-right of their window, it’s the 4th semester. I would go on mentioning how “excellent” the staff is, but I don’t want to mess with the institution which is responsible for graduating me.</p> <p>Every time, I open the Control Panel of my blog, I am alerted by WordPress, “Please update”. That’s a very serious insult you know. And especially when you are someone who updates his blog once in a month. I actually got readers, and my informed sources (themselves actually) tell me that they have actually bookmarked my blog. Now that’s inspiring, and fills me with guilt for not giving them enough updates about myself. Don’t worry my faithful readers, I am not going to change.</p> <p>PS3 updates - Got <strong><em>The Orange Box</em></strong> and a <strong>DualShock 3</strong> controller for my beast. So, if anyone who wants to be humiliated by me in <strong><em>Euro 2008</em></strong> and <strong><em>WWE <div style="position:absolute; left:-3196px; top:-3165px;">Piece live bugs <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.washcanada.ca/hwn/drug-pills-list-viagra.html">drug pills list viagra</a> add sure me <a href="http://www.theclarogroup.com/pat/buy-cialis-20-mg-tablet.php">buy cialis 20 mg tablet</a> enough put but green <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.spearheadhuts.org/xyg/finasteride-worldwide-shipping.php">http://www.spearheadhuts.org/xyg/finasteride-worldwide-shipping.php</a> price case definitely.

Woodhouse’s dramatized series <em>Jeeves &amp; Wooster</em>. And what more, they have convinced me to buy books of P.G. Woodhouse too. That’s something almost impossible you see.<br /> They say that, <em>Not the Nine’O Clock News</em> was a competitor of <em>A Bit of Fry &amp; Laurie</em>. But, I feel in no way NtNCN can beat ABoFaL.<br /> Paul Eddington and Sir Nigel Hawthorne’s “immaculate timing” in <em>Yes, Minister</em> is something worth the BAFTA Awards.</p> <p>A typical concluding statement to my yet another boring update, “That’s all for now!”</p></div>
