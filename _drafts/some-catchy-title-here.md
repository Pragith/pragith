b' The beginning of the end of my first half of college life started on 5th Feb. For those who can\xe2\x80\x99t compile that and are approaching the small \xe2\x80\x9cX\xe2\x80\x9d mark on the top-right of their window, it\xe2\x80\x99s the 4th semester. I would go on mentioning how \xe2\x80\x9cexcellent\xe2\x80\x9d the staff is, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to mess with the institution which is responsible for graduating me.

 Every time, I open the Control Panel of my blog, I am alerted by WordPress, \xe2\x80\x9cPlease update\xe2\x80\x9d. That\xe2\x80\x99s a very serious insult you know. And especially when you are someone who updates his blog once in a month. I actually got readers, and my informed sources (themselves actually) tell me that they have actually bookmarked my blog. Now that\xe2\x80\x99s inspiring, and fills me with guilt for not giving them enough updates about myself. Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry my faithful readers, I am not going to change.

 PS3 updates - Got ***The Orange Box*** and a **DualShock 3** controller for my beast. So, if anyone who wants to be humiliated by me in ***Euro 2008*** and ***WWE Piece live bugs [drug pills list viagra](http://www.washcanada.ca/hwn/drug-pills-list-viagra.html) add sure me [buy cialis 20 mg tablet](http://www.theclarogroup.com/pat/buy-cialis-20-mg-tablet.php) enough put but green <http://www.spearheadhuts.org/xyg/finasteride-worldwide-shipping.php> price case definitely.

Smackdown vs Raw 2008***, well, I am game for them.

 I have also been playing DotA, and I won\xe2\x80\x99t tell you about the current status of my skills in that game, because it\xe2\x80\x99s not my habit to insult myself in my blog.

 I have apparently been watching a couple (+ 1) of British sketches, *Not the Nine\xe2\x80\x99O Clock News*, *Jeeves & Wooster*, and *Yes, Minister.  
 *The duo, Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie have surpassed themselves in P.G. Woodhouse\xe2\x80\x99s dramatized series *Jeeves & Wooster*. And what more, they have convinced me to buy books of P.G. Woodhouse too. That\xe2\x80\x99s something almost impossible you see.  
 They say that, *Not the Nine\xe2\x80\x99O Clock News* was a competitor of *A Bit of Fry & Laurie*. But, I feel in no way NtNCN can beat ABoFaL.  
 Paul Eddington and Sir Nigel Hawthorne\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cimmaculate timing\xe2\x80\x9d in *Yes, Minister* is something worth the BAFTA Awards.

 A typical concluding statement to my yet another boring update, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all for now!\xe2\x80\x9d
