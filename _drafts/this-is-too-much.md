Yes, really! And when you listen to my "<em>dard bhari kahaani", </em>you will also feel pity for me.

Tuesdays are my Workshop Lab, where we are made to work like a slave in the British Era. Err... slightly less than that. We have to file, cut, and fit Mild Steel pieces. I will be uploading the pictures of the models I have completed shortly. So, you can see how much I/we have to work on Tuesdays.

Now, Wednesdays! We have our Physics Lab where whatever we do is negligible. Today was our demonstration class, where our teacher showed how to perform the experiments which we will be starting from next week. Sat for around 2 hours, and just listened to what he was talking. Now, I hope you can imagine how I would have felt.

These two extreme days have equal effect on me. I feel so damn hungry and tired, that staying awake after coming home is next to impossible.
