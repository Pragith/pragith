b'Tomorrow, I am going to reach a milestone (at least that\'s what I have heard) in my life. Drastic changes in me since I was born for sure. But sometimes I feel, 18 isn\'t the correct age for calling oneself, "Adult". 

 According to me, after 21-22 years, one really becomes matured (to an extent); because at around that time, one graduates from education For sample [buy zoloft without prescription](http://www.thelearningcoalition.org/zje/buy-zoloft-without-prescription/) store mist clinic.

At the same time, it doesn\'t mean to me, that a kid who is aged between "the time it starts talking" to "18", is immature.

However, instead of giving a lecture on this, me better come backs to my life. Me exams started today, and will stretch like a vulcanized rubber till 15th July. After that me\'s solitary holidays would start, and me is planning to waste (not exactly) the time by revising the basics of Linux (Red Hat), and learning Photoshop CS3 (which me had been postponing infinitely before).

 I launched a new micro blog, [Teen Tumblr](http://teentumblr.co.cc) as a mark to my new phase of life. Let\'s see how far I am able to maintain it. And I am also a *not so* addict of [Twitter](http://twitter.com/pragith). So you can catch me there also LIVE!
