b' \r\n\r\nStumbled upon a [personal money management](https://www.mint.com/) software called **Mint** which is currently available only to US customers. I found it listed on Lifehacker under [best budgeting sites](http://lifehacker.com/5584273/five-best-personal-money-management-sites). Its **simple looking interface** and the fact that it\'s **FREE** caught my attention in the first glance.\r\n\r\nMint is a web based application which acts as a single portal to all your financial accounts. In that portal you can set your budgets, look at your transactions and set "goals" for savings. As you can see in the picture below, the [iOS app](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mint-com-personal-finance/id300238550?mt=8) brings the statistics right in the palm of your hand so that you can keep the information on the move.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n![](http://pragith.net/wp-content/042211_1905_MintcomMone19.png)(Source: [Mint](https://www.mint.com/))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is achieved by linking your US bank accounts (all types) with the application during signup. No need to worry, it\'s completely secure. After linking your bank account, Mint will fetch all your recent transactions automatically and will present to you with beautiful graphs and charts. Now something which I really care about is savings and Mint does a [very good job](https://www.mint.com/how-it-works/save/) at it. They analyze all the variables, the spending and even suggest best possible home loan option too.\r\n\r\nMint\'s features look quite promising and I would recommend my readers to go ahead and give it a spin. I\'m sure you would agree with my points too.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
