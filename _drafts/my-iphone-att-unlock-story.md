 **Update #2:** Please read the AT&T guidelines before commenting. A lot has changed since I unlocked in April. Many rules and restrictions which I am not aware of now.

  I bought my iPhone 4 from BestBuy for $549.99 locked to AT&T in Feb 2011. It was on 04.10.01 baseband and I\'ve been maintaining that till iOS 5.0.1.

 This story applies to all those people who have NEVER been a customer of AT&T. The only relation between them & AT&T is that their device has been locked to AT&T.

 **Story:**

  * Called +1 800 331 0500 & logged an unlock request on 8th April
 * In 2 days, got an email asking me to send them a fax with proof of purchase, my IMEI, case number
 * Used http://faxzero.com and sent them the requested details on the 3rd day. Please note that if you don\'t have a receipt, it\'s absolutely fine. Don\'t freak out for heaven\'s sake!!!
 * On 5th day (i.e. today), I got an email saying that they\'ve unlocked my device
 * I used redsn0w to deactivate my iPhone. Put my SIM in, and it is working fine now :) (Personal Hotspot works too)
  **Facts**:

  * Apple or AT&T does NOT push any unlock code via email (like some blog posts have been wrongly informing)
 * There is nothing called UNLOCK CODE when it comes to unlocking your iPhone. AT&T Customer Reps ARE WRONG if they use such terms
 * Apple has a list. If your iPhone Economical using, once Started [chloramphenicol canada drugs](http://www.theclarogroup.com/pat/chloramphenicol-canada-drugs.php) organic on that.

Generally termed as Whitelist. If you have a stolen device or such, they\'ll put your IMEI in their Blacklist
 * AT&T is just a mediator. They forward your request to Apple after verifying your details. Like a firewall. Apple is only putting your IMEI in their whitelist
 * AT&T doesn\'t really need any proof of purchase. If you are confident that your device is legal, then just tell them the real story. If you don\'t have any receipt, then tell them that you don\'t have one. As simple as that

 **My Advice:**

  * Please note that AT&T doesn\'t email you much unless they need something or have taken any action. So you won\'t know if they are actually working on. Of course you can keep bugging them on phone. They are really sweet :)
 * Wait till your case end date. My case got resolved 3 days before itself. But it might take time for you. Rest assured it\'ll be done within your case end date
 * Don\'t be excited. I was. No point in being excited. Don\'t get disappointed because as I said, they really don\'t keep in touch with you unless something is done
 * Don\'t post your IMEI numbers ANYWHERE on the Internet
 * Your story may not match anybody else\'s story. If someone got it unlocked within few seconds/minutes, then they\'re probably a celeb (kidding). Once again, wait till your case end date
   

 **Tips:**

  * Call center number : +1 800 331 0500 (7AM to 10PM Eastern Time)
 * After hours : +1 866 801 3600 (they are same as regular call center)
 * Use Google Voice or Skype
