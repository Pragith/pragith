b'Blogging about this a little late, but anyways, here is the reason why I have made the domain <http://pragith.net/> redirect to my blog.  
As many of you might be knowing that I only update my blog. Since, I wasn\'t updating my website, and was only updating a folder (sub-directory) of my domain, so by blog wasn\'t getting proper rankings. So, I did a redirect in the .htaccess file which from now on will redirect, <http://pragith.net/> and <http://www.pragith.net/> to my blog i.e. <http://pragith.net/blog>
