b'Lately, I have been seeing this trend that people are searching for web hosts to start their own website or a blog. And in this blog post, I will be showing you all on how to search for the best host which meets all your requirements.\r\n\r\nI stumbled upon this website which has lots of [web hosting tutorials](http://webhostingrating.com/articles/). This website tells you how start your website from scratch. Starting from tips from choosing the domain name, to the required features from cheap hosting websites.\r\n\r\nOn the left side of the website, you will see the boxes which are aptly named related with the web hosts like, the **Top 10** web hosts,** [Categories](http://webhostingrating.com/articles/category/cheap-web-hosting/)** (which filter the hosts according to the software package they give to their customers), **Post Tags** (which show the mostly searched keywords), and a unique **Hosting Awards 2008** section which feature the best of best hosts in their respective fields.\r\n\r\nThere is a page called as [Directory](http://webhostingrating.com/directory) which gives a detailed review about all the web hosts present on the Internet. As a conclusion, I would like to direct my readers who wish to own a website of their own to search for a good host in this website and launch it.'
