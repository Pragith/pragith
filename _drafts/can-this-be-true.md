b'Now this small math equation made me dumb struck. My friend, Venkat told me about this.\r\n\r\n**The Hypothesis \xe2\x80\x93 Folding a paper sheet 50 equal times can make you reach the Sun!\r\n**\r\n\r\n**Apparatus Required** \xe2\x80\x93 A sheet of paper (any size)\r\n\r\n**Method** \xe2\x80\x93 All you have to do is to fold it to 50 equal times. Practically speaking, it\'s impossible. So, I would suggest the readers to not to go and practically do it and waste your time. Instead pay attention to equation below and leave your thoughts about it.\r\n\r\nLet\'s assume that the thickness of the paper is 0.1mm.\r\n\r\nSo, if you fold it 50 times equally, it will be 0.1mm x 2^50 (^ stands for "raised to the power")\r\n\r\nmore\r\n\r\nWhy I did 2^50?\r\nReason: Let\'s take 3 folds for example (and yeah, you can go and do this to believe me)\r\nAfter you checked doing 3 folds, you will come to know that the thickness has now become 8 times. Which leads to the conclusion that it\'s 2^3 which is 8.\r\n\r\nNow let\'s get back to the equation.\r\n\r\nSo, 0.1mm x 2^50 leads to 1.12x10^14 mm or 112.58x10^6 km.\r\n\r\nIt\'s stated that Sun is around 146 million km far from Earth. And this hypothesis can make you reach it with just a sheet of paper. (Don\'t forget to thank me once you reach the Sun) ;)'
