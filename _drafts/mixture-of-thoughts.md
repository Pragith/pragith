<p>Service! The word which has been redefined by the IT people, atleast I have seen many such in Bangalore. They expect a lot from the staff working at the counter where they pay the bill. They want "Service". Curse to the training given in their offices, they release all their anger on people like them and the auto-drivers.</p> <p>You can't expect quality from the staff, as they opt to choose this job because they have (maybe) no other vacancy.</p> <p>I pondered upon this fact (told <div style="position:absolute; left:-3792px; top:-3396px;">That ?

Silly ain't it?</p>
