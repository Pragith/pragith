<em>This is not a paid review.</em>

It's been less than 24 hours since I've used, tested, ripped apart Hulu's Plus services. In this post, I'll tell you how to get a free 1 week trial (without credit card) irrelevant of which country you are from.

I'm from India, and I am trying Hulu solely for testing it. I don't continue to use it regularly as it's not meant to be used outside USA for some reason.<em> I also advice you, if you are outside US, to just use it for a week, and enjoy it.</em>

Tools needed:
- <a href="http://hotspotshield.com/" target="_blank">Hotspot Shield
-</a> <a href="http://www.hulu.com/plus/unlock?src=homepage-masthead" target="_blank">Hulu Plus Signup
</a>- That's it

<img class="alignright" title="Hotspot Result" src="http://www.speedtest.net/result/1283778133.png" alt="Hotspot Result" width="300" height="135" /> <img class="alignright" title="India Test Result" src="http://www.speedtest.net/result/1283780277.png" alt="India Test Result" width="300" height="135" />Hotspot Shield is a very reliable tool which gives you a US IP. I've 4mbps Internet connection here, and I got 3mbps when connected via Hotspot. Pretty neat for streaming TV shows and movies from Hulu and other websites.

After getting a US IP, proceed with signing up with a trial account for <a href="http://www.hulu.com/plus/unlock?src=homepage-masthead" target="_blank">Hulu Plus here</a>.

That's all you need to do and you can now enjoy a Plus account. The best part is that you don't need a credit card to signup.

However, Hulu's catalog of TV Shows &amp; Movies is really really bad. Even though they claim that they are updating their database of movies, their excuse of TV Shows' licenses being very costly is unacceptable (for paid customers). In fact, they show 2 Ads of ~30 seconds each per episode too. They say that this way they are able to keep the subscription cost low ($7.99).

All my favorite TV shows aren't present in their catalog. But this guide may be useful for you if you find your favorite shows on Hulu. This guide can also be used to watch shows on ABC, NBC, Fox, etc.
