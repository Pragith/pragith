b'I recently stumbled upon this blog post [Wholesale Replica Sunglasses](http://www.replicasunglasses4u.com/) and was enlightened on how to go and purchase the original glasses.

 As this site clearly defines the meaning of the word "Replica", most of us mis-use the meaning and go for the cheaper model of the sun glasses. But it isn\'t always the fault of the person who is going out to purchase the glass, most of them get fooled.

 So, here are few methods which I learned from the blog-post:

 1) What carries us to go for the replica model is that they contain the logo of the Easier lip.

 2) The glasses are of cheap quality. When you see them under the shade of sun, you can see the rainbow colors, which clearly show the type of material used.

 3) The legal [Wholesale Sunglasses](http://www.ctswholesalers.com/) look similar but not 100% identical to designer glasses, whereas the case is otherwise in illegal replicas.

 4) Legal replica sun glasses have disclaimer on their websites, but the illegal sun glasses don\'t.

 For more information, read the blog-post mentioned above. Don\'t get fooled.
