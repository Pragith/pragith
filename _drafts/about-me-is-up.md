Hello my dear readers. I hope you would be dying to know me (no, this time I ain't sarcastic), and hence I took some time to update my "About Me" section, and you now can drool all over your keyboard by reading how awesome I am (yeah, this time I leave it to you whether I am sarcastic or not).

Another quick reminder to my dear friends; These days, I have been talking in Third Person, so please please DON'T think that I am going wrong on this part (yeah, I do mess up with grammar sometimes).

For e.g. I solves Rubik's Cube, I is hungry.
