With <a href="http://vtu.ac.in">VTU</a> students having their exams starting from Dec. 31<sup>st</sup> till Jan. end, the dawn of a new year looks like just_another_day. The one of the most awaited day of an year, was a total party spoiler because of the Semester exams. The poor students did express their disappointment in the newspapers, but one cannot change the authority, right?

Beat that, the University announced that the next semester is starting from 4<sup>th</sup> Feb. onwards, with hardly a gap of 4-5 days after the last external exam. What do you have to say about that?
