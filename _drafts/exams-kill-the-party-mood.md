b'With [VTU](http://vtu.ac.in) students having their exams starting from Dec. 31st till Jan. end, the dawn of a new year looks like just\_another\_day. The one of the most awaited day of an year, was a total party spoiler because of the Semester exams. The poor students did express their disappointment in the newspapers, but one cannot change the authority, right?\r\n\r\nBeat that, the University announced that the next semester is starting from 4th Feb. onwards, with hardly a gap of 4-5 days after the last external exam. What do you have to say about that?'
