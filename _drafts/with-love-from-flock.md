b'Here\'s a quickie,\r\n\r\nWeb 2.0 is growing so fast, and I feel I am very much not updated to the latest inventions in this field.\r\n\r\nIf anyone feels that they are also lagging behind and are suffering like me by not subscribing to Tech Magz, then do the following things :\r\n\r\n1) Install [Flock](http://flock.com/)\r\n-Get used to the interface\r\n2) Subscribe to the following feeds :\r\n-[Crave Gadget News](http://news.cnet.com/8300-17938_105-1.xml)\r\n-[Webware](http://news.cnet.com/8300-17939_109-2.xml)\r\n3) (Optional) Start using [Twitter](http://twitter.com/)\r\n\r\nBoth the websites are from CNET, and the articles published over there are completely authentic.\r\n\r\nWith love,\r\nFrom Flock ;)'
