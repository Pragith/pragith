b"How to PWN your friend? A n00b friendly guide for my readers from the master of PWNGES - a.k.a. The Pragnetizer!\r\n\r\n0) Be a man!\r\n\r\n1) Take a nap, and come online.\r\n\r\n2) Check your contact list, and target your victim.\r\n\r\n3) Make sure your victim is chatting with your other friend.\r\n\r\n4) Go and ping both of them, and ask about their recent conversations, and make sure they aren't personal.\r\n\r\nNow for the main part. Make sure your target isn't tech savvy and doesn't know much about Google, Yahoo! and MSN.\r\n\r\n**5) Give your friend few lines which only you and your target talk normally, and tell him/her to paste it in their conversation box.**\r\n\r\n6) Wait for your target to faint.\r\n\r\n7) GOTO Step-5.\r\n\r\n8) Then ask your dear friend to paste whatever your victim is typing, and respond accordingly. Do this until your victim gets frustrated and goes to gym.\r\n\r\n9) Roll on the floor laughing.\r\n\r\n10) Tell your mum about the whole incident.\r\n\r\nOptional step (To be taken only when your victim is a n00b in Short Message Service too) :\r\n\r\n--Tell your victim that whatever messages he/she is sending to your friend to delete the previous chats (which you might be reading according to the victim) are getting redirected to your email account.\r\nCongratulations! Your friend just got Pragnetized!!!
