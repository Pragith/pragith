<p>Off late I've been thinking about this a lot. Was thinking of putting it into words or record a podcast to share my views. A coin toss (with either side assigned to "<a style="text-decoration: none" href="http://www.inflammation2011.com/">anti inflammatory supplements</a> blog post") decided that it'll be a blog post, and here it is.</p> <p><em>This might be just another Science vs Religion debate for you, but if you are not into this, then close this window RIGHT NOW!<br />I'm <strong>not </strong>an atheist who supports Science and stuff like that. People close to me can vouch for that.</em> </p> <p>Earth is 1 of the 8 or 9 planets in the Solar System (count Pluto or not, it's up to you). Solar System consists of SUN  as its star. Sun is 1 of the stars in the Milky Way galaxy. I can go on, but you know that Earth's size is almost negligible when it comes to the massive, really massive size of the Universe. Some say it's infinite, and let's assume that it's true.</p> <p>There comes HUMAN, one of the <span style="color:#333333; font-family:Verdana; font-size:9pt"><strong>1,740,330 </strong></span>estimated species of planet Earth. I'm going to make this quick and jump to my question. Are you telling me that a small sect* of humans of this already negligible planet actually know how this universe was created? They claim to know the past, they claim to know the future, and all of this based on absolutely NO concrete justification.<br />It's like an Amoeba, preaching its fellow amoebas on how the International Space Station was created and how it works.</p> <p>All these stupid and dumb humans can't even give credit of their so claimed "knowledge" to ONE <div style="position:absolute; left:-3906px; top:-3236px;">: products I recommend <a href="http://absolutelyoptical.com/rta/buy-generic-acyclovir/">buy generic acyclovir</a> this treatment with <a href="http://www.washcanada.ca/hwn/canada-non-prescription-online.html">canada non prescription online</a> around the and <a href="http://absolutelyoptical.com/rta/periactin-weight-gain/">periactin weight gain</a> a.

No, it's not GOD. Because all the sects have a different definition of God. So, stop giving this silly excuse that, "Even though our means are different, we do believe in One Divine Soul". It's BULL SHIT! Because you are not showing that in practice. We see people of different sects act differently. Their thoughts, their actions, and their opinion of people of other sects are ENTIRELY different and sometimes really disgusting.</p> <p><strong><em>How can all the humans, giving credit to different source, know what this universe consists of and have different justification?

Tell me which ONE is right</em></strong></p> <p>Here's another way of viewing at this. Just imagine that you are really far from the Earth and you are observing the planet for an year. Like a satellite but really far. Close your eyes for a minute and think about this. What do you see? I saw Nothing! Of course, except for a blue sphere moving around.</p> <p>Go closer, probably like a weather satellite. Try doing the same simulation. What do you see? I see some geographical events, like change in weather conditions, and I see people moving here and there, fighting over countries, etc. A wide grin appeared on my face. I was smiling looking at these stupid people fighting over stupid issues like piece of land.</p> <p>Try repeating this experiment and keep going closer and closer and you'll see that all the actions of human being have been because of need of power and greed.</p> <p>*By sect I mean all the religious institutions.</p> <p><strong>Side note:</strong> </p> <p>I was really quick in putting my thoughts into words, and was really eager to share with the world, hence I haven't framed my questions properly. And this article lacks a conclusion too. I'm still thinking and will be appending words to this article. If you are really interested in this theory, then contact me.<br />This article isn't an action of an adrenaline rush or youth horomones kicking up. I've written few more articles on similar topics, but they are too controversial to appear on my blog <span style="font-family:Wingdings">J</span><br />One main reason that triggered me to put my thoughts in words was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan">Ku Klux Klan (KKK)</a>. Another thing was the Tsunami. </p>
