This post is dedicated to Social Web Security, as I am able to see many people misusing the true power of Social Networking. This post is for people who are "Careless", "Its-OK", "So-what?" kind of members of websites like Orkut, MySpace, Friendster, Facebook, etc.

So to be safe, follow these rules else there are people following you!!!

1)Choose a good nickname (if you'd rather not use your real name) and try not to choose one that sounds retarded.

2) If you want to invite more of your friends to the site, don't just dump your entire contact list and send a mass invite. Keep it personal, and keep work friends / colleagues for business networking sites and your personal friends for more casual sites.

3) If you ask to add someone to your list, do it just once. Persisting is not just irritating, it's also rude, and can even be considered <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberstalking" target="_blank">cyber-stalking</a>.

4) Don't just start adding people you don't know, as friends-it will make you seem desperate.

5) Watch your language and steer clear of flame wars (insulting someone you don't like).

6) If you're joining a network for fun, don't use your real name. Some people prefer to use a false address; I'd suggest not putting any addresses or personal details such as your mobile phone number.

7) Once you're done with your profile, make sure to set the right access masks for different user groups.

8 ) You don't have to be friends with people you don't really like.

9) Don't save your password on a shared computer.

Stay Safe!!! Happy Social Networking!!!
