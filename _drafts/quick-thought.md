 Let\'s assume that "everything" in this world is destroyed including all the living beings but the planet remains the same.  
 We are left only with George Lucas\' sketches of his Star Wars movie franchise. (You can think of any other sketches too, like Tom & Jerry, etc.)

 Yes, only that and rest everything is destroyed.

 Humans start taking birth (of course from nowhere), and find these sketches.  
 Let\'s also assume that they are matured enough to interpret and communicate with each other, etc.

 So do you think they will come to a conclusion that "this" is how their ancestors were?

 I feel there would be 2 opposing sects.

 1) One which will research on natural surroundings, try to get clues on whether the sketches are real or not. They\'ll try to see how old the sketches are.

 2) The other one will blindly take the artwork into consideration, make George Lucas (director of the movie) as "God" - the Creator of "the characters" on sketches, Darth Vader (villian in the movie) as the devil/satan, and Obi-Wan Kenobi (sort of father figure/hero in the movie) as their saviour. Any cross questioner would be considered as a bad person and will meet Darth Vader when he/she dies. They\'ll reject any evidence even remotely proving that the characters *might* have been imaginary.

 Are you smiling? It\'s because YOU know that they were a creation of simple minds. A fiction. Made with a simple purpose of entertaining people and earning money. But THEY (the new born humans) don\'t know that :)

 Would love to know your views on this. Do leave your comment (I generally never ask readers to do that).
