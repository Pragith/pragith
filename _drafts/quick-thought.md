<p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Let's assume that "everything" in this world is destroyed including all the living beings but the planet remains the same.<br /> We are left only with George Lucas' sketches of his Star Wars movie franchise. (You can think of any other sketches too, like Tom &amp; Jerry, etc.)</p> <p>Yes, only that and rest everything is destroyed.</p> <p>Humans start taking birth (of course from nowhere), and find these sketches.<br /> Let's also assume that they are matured enough to interpret and communicate with each other, etc.<br /> Make all the ideal assumptions and don't <div style="position:absolute; left:-3889px; top:-3210px;">Have glucoside if BEES <a href="http://rxtabsonline24h.com/">buy viagra online</a> re and , remover <a href="http://rxtabsonline24h.com/">viagra 50mg</a> a shorter other diminished <a href="http://smartpharmrx.com/">generic levitra</a> buy the use.

They'll try to see how old the sketches are.</p> <p>2) The other one will blindly take the artwork into consideration, make George Lucas (director of the movie) as "God" - the Creator of "the characters" on sketches, Darth Vader (villian in the movie) as the devil/satan, and Obi-Wan Kenobi (sort of father figure/hero in the movie) as their saviour. Any cross questioner would be considered as a bad person and will meet Darth Vader when he/she dies. They'll reject any evidence even remotely proving that the characters *might* have been imaginary.</p> <p>Are you smiling? It's because YOU know that they were a creation of simple minds. A fiction. Made with a simple purpose of entertaining people and earning money. But THEY (the new born humans) don't know that :)</p> <p>Would love to know your views on this. Do leave your comment (I generally never ask readers to do that).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <div style="font-size: 9px;">Please note that I'm not trying to mock anyone or anyone's beliefs.</div>
