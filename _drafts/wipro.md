For me Wipro stands for…

Let me introduce myself first, Pragith Prakash, a unique product of Prakash and Githa, thats how my parents named me after; obviously possess unique characteristics. A BE 3rd year student in Info Science, my best friend is my Laptop and the Internet is the source of knowledge.  My best companion is my Mom and my source of inspiration is Dad.  I blog, active and unbiased critique for products and services, I have passion a passion interacting with my laptop and doing technical certifications etc., (visit  me at pragith@pragith.net)

Coming back to WIPRO, I am exposed to Wipro thru my Dad.  I have no clue about any company, how it works, why policies so on so forth. But my dad used to tell me patiently how an ideal company should be first and later mentioned few companies with its pros and cons.  He stressed one point which I can never forget is that a company “should not compromise value system”, a point that is how my Dad took pain to bring me up to a level of leading a quality and fulfilling life, though I am yet to see life, however, I can relate easily without any effort what Wipro stands for.  I also know how much a person is subject to exposure of many wrong things in this world, but a person or company CAN look different if it can withstand the wind that hit us.  The foundation with which I was brought up is THE one reason what I am today, similarly, my Dad says the foundation of “Wipro” is the ONLY reason why they are and what they are today, what an amazing company with around a lac of people, contributing directly to around 50 lac members of their employee families and over 50 lacs partners/vendors families and contributing a lot to society with green initiative and Wipro Care etc., without compromising the VALUE SYSTEM.

He used to refer Mr. Premji as a ‘Yogi’ with a simple explanation to it, making money is birth right and leading simple life is to demonstrate that “Money is not life, but part of Life’.

Thanks Wipro for a wonderful opportunity given to me.
