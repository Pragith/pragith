b'I recently updated to uTorrent 3.2.2 only to find an ugly looking advertisement sporting "Featured Torrent".\n\nIf you find it annoying too, then here\'s how you can remove it:\n\n\t2. Go *Options* ->;*Preferences*
\n\t4. Go to *Advanced*
\n\t6. In the *Filter* box, type *offer*
\n\t8. You\'ll find ***offers.sponsored\_torrent\_offer\_enabled***
\n\t10. By default it\'s set to *true*. Select ***false***
\n\t12. Press *OK* and restart uTorrent
\n\nVoila!\n\n**By Fred** from comments:\n\n
> Also changing offers.left\_rail\_offer\_enabled to "false" gets rid of the advert box on the bottom left and replaces with the standard "upgrade to pro" add\n\n\nThanks Fred!'
