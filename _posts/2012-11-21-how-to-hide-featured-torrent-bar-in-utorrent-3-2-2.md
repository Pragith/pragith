I recently updated to uTorrent 3.2.2 only to find an ugly looking advertisement sporting "Featured Torrent".

If you find it annoying too, then here\'s how you can remove it:

\t2. Go *Options* ->;*Preferences*

\t4. Go to *Advanced*

\t6. In the *Filter* box, type *offer*

\t8. You\'ll find ***offers.sponsored\_torrent\_offer\_enabled***

\t10. By default it\'s set to *true*. Select ***false***

\t12. Press *OK* and restart uTorrent


Voila!

> Also changing offers.left\_rail\_offer\_enabled to "false" gets rid of the advert box on the bottom left and replaces with the standard "upgrade to pro" add


Thanks Fred!
