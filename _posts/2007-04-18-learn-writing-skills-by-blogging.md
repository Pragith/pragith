<p>Yes, I have observed one thing that by blogging you can improve your writing skills. Though mine is still improving, but I can see some minute changes so far in my English writing skills. You can also improve by reading other's blogs (like mine :P).</p> <p>So, I encourage all my readers to go and start blogging. It is very easy to start your own. Simply <a href="http://wordpress.com/signup/">CLICK HERE</a> and register yourself, and your blog is ready.</p> <p>If you are having any trouble in starting up the blog or getting confused with the interface, then you can always contact me at <strong>pragith@pragith.net</strong></p> <p>or you can chat with me on Yahoo! Messenger. My id is <strong>ppragith</strong></p>
