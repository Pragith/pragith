b'My college life started on 3rd September. College is superb, teachers are cool, and got some friends.  
 I am studying B.E. in I.S. (also known as I.T.) in [CMRIT](http://cmredu.cmrit.com), Bangalore

 Other updates are as follows :-

 > I saw the complete series of the famous British Skit (lead role by Rowan Atkinson) named [Blackadder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackadder). Simply superb, I am addicted to it, its the height of sarcastic comedy.

 > Got a laptop, [Dell VOSTRO 1400 N-Series](http://forum.notebookreview.com/showthread.php?t=151760&page=1), for college works from college.

 > Playing [Halo](http://bungie.net/projects/Halo/default.aspx) a lot, have to stop it now, my internal exams are near. New life, New theme.
