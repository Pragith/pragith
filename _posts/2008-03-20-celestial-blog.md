<p>Whoa!!!</p> <p>I am so happy today. I feel that my blog is so famous that even the God reads it . If you have read the following blog posts, they clearly indicate my complaint about the climate in Bangalore.</p> <p>And guess what, it's been raining kittens and puppies here. Me and my friends took full advantage of it. We went to the open Cafeteria near our college canteen, and I opened my laptop, and we all started listening and singing songs.</p> <p>People here say that it's not usual to have rain during this time of the year, but hey, who cares?!?! As long as the weather is chill, you will see more and more positive blog posts on my website ;)</p>
