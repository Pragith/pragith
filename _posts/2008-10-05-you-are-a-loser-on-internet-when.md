b'You know that you are a loser on Internet when...

 ***1.You don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to write in proper English. You use \xe2\x80\x9cma\xe2\x80\x9d instead of \xe2\x80\x9cmy\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cwatevea\xe2\x80\x9d instead of \xe2\x80\x9cwhatever\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cheLLo\xe2\x80\x9d instead of \xe2\x80\x9cHello\xe2\x80\x9d. You put extra letters to a word. For example; \xe2\x80\x9cLiFE3\xe2\x80\x9d in lieu of \xe2\x80\x9cLife\xe2\x80\x9d. You prefer to use sms language on forums. Moreover, you think that it\xe2\x80\x99s cool to write like this.***

 ***2.While browsing these sites, you send friend requests to girls and continuously check out their profiles. If they don\xe2\x80\x99t accept it then also you keep on sending requests.***

 ***3.You try to use \xe2\x80\x9cUnlock Photo Albums Scripts\xe2\x80\x9d on the profiles of girls or your ex-lovers.***

 ***4.You just can\xe2\x80\x99t complete your sentence without typing \xe2\x80\x9cLolz\xe2\x80\x9d.***

 ***5.You send forward messages to your friends as scraps. For example; \xe2\x80\x9cYour mother will die if u don\xe2\x80\x99t forward it to 10 people\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll sleep with your girlfriend if you don\xe2\x80\x99t send it to 100 people\xe2\x80\x9d.***

 ***6.You\xe2\x80\x99ve 200+ friends on Orkut but you don\xe2\x80\x99t know half of them. Moreover, you don\xe2\x80\x99t even talk to them. This is because you think that having 200+ friends makes you popular.***

 ***7.You have a fake profile to spy on your ex- girlfriend/ boyfriend.***

 ***8.You\xe2\x80\x99re using a picture of Hannah Montana/Hilary Duff as your profile picture.***

 ***9.You don\xe2\x80\x99t know your neighbor but you know about the latest games on Myspace.***

 ***10.You fight with people in communities and forums while in real life you don\xe2\x80\x99t have the guts to say anything.***

 ***11.In real life, you say \xe2\x80\x9cLOL\xe2\x80\x9d in place of laughing.***

 ***12.After reading this, you are totally pissed off at me and now you\xe2\x80\x99re going to the comment box to abuse me.***

 ***13.You copy this whole guide and forward it to your friends through email or post it on social networking websites or internet forums.***

 Well, only the 13th point is apt on me. How many are true on your side?
