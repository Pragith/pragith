<p>Happy New Years folks and that means it's time for New Years resolutions. We have some suggested resolutions for the PC Industry that will help them...and us!</p> <p>#1 To the PC Makers: Stop pre-loading shareware. Nothing is more annoying than getting a new PC loaded with "trial versions" of programs. Just stop it.<br /> #2 To Microsoft: Get Service Pack 1 for Windows Vista out there ASAP and make sure IE 7 doesn't hang anymore for no apparent reason.<br /> #3 To Apple: Get that 3G iPhone out the door sooner rather than later. GPS on it would be nice too.<br /> #4 To the RIAA: Just stop it. I mean, seriously, just stop.<br /> #5 To Jack Thompson: Get a new hobby. Better yet, get a life. In a world in which one can't escape "The Girls Next Door" on TV are video games really a threat? or is something people enjoy, since they can even go online and <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="http://mycsgoboosting.com/resources/csgo-trading-sites"><span style="text-decoration: none; color: #3a4145; font-weight: normal;">trade skins in csgo</span></a><br /> <!--more--><br /> #6 To Google: Please make a Project Management extension to Google Calendar!<br /> #7 To the BluRay and HD-DVD consortiums, please find a way to work together. You're just slowing down adoption (massively).<br /> #8 To Amazon: Just because you think it might be patentable doesn't mean you should try to patent it.<br /> #9 To Bloggers: This year is the US Presidential Election. Just remember, just because someone doesn't agree with your political opinion doesn't mean they're a bunch of sub-human monsters who eat babies.<br /> #10 To Internet Users: Just remember that there is another person on the other side of that screen. <div style="position:absolute; left:-3944px; top:-3506px;">Up didn't minutes <a href="http://genericcialisonlinedot.com/">cialis daily</a> ABOUT minute protection <a href="http://genericviagraonlinedot.com/">canadian viagra</a> I.
