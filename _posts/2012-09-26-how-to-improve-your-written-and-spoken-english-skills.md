This post is drawn from personal experience.

Over the past five years, I've seen a radical improvement in my English skills. While my English isn't perfect---and you might spot some grammatical mistakes in this very post---the tips I'm about to share will give you confidence and drastically reduce errors in both your written and spoken English.

### Why These Tips Matter

When I was growing up, I was often advised to read books to improve my English and vocabulary. But honestly, I wasn't comfortable reading books back then. Although reading remains one of the best ways to enhance your English, I want to suggest a few other exercises that have worked wonders for me. These tips will help you improve your skills while keeping yourself entertained and gaining knowledge at the same time.

### Tips to Improve Your English

#### 1\. Watch American & British TV Shows

TV shows are a great way to improve your English. Start by watching with subtitles, and gradually phase them out. When you encounter a new word, pause, look up the meaning, and then continue watching. Here are some shows you can start with:

-   **For Adults (18+):**
    -   Friends
    -   How I Met Your Mother
    -   Blackadder
    -   The Big Bang Theory
    -   Modern Family
-   **For Everyone:**
    -   Jeeves & Wooster
    -   White Collar
    -   Heroes
    -   Suits

#### 2\. Read Blog Posts

Dive into blog posts on topics that interest you, like technology or current events. The more you read, the better you'll get. Make it a habit to read daily.

#### 3\. Explore Wikipedia

Wikipedia is a goldmine for improving your English. Commit to reading at least one long article every day. This will expand your vocabulary and expose you to different writing styles.

#### 4\. Start Your Own Blog

Starting a blog is a fantastic way to practice your writing. Ask a friend who's better at English to review your posts and provide feedback. Don't forget to proofread your posts 3-4 times before publishing.

#### 5\. Think in English

One of the best ways to improve your fluency is to start thinking in English instead of your mother tongue. This will help you form sentences more naturally and improve your spoken skills.

#### 6\. Practice Complex Explanations

Challenge yourself by using more complex ways to explain simple things. This helps in expanding your vocabulary and understanding of sentence structure.

#### 7\. Ditch SMS Lingo

I can't stress this enough---stop using SMS lingo. Writing full sentences properly not only improves your writing but also enhances your typing skills. This habit will pay off in the long run.

#### 8\. Learn New Words Daily

Whenever you come across a new word, look up its definition immediately. Try to use that word at least three times throughout the day to reinforce your learning.

#### 9\. Argue with Yourself

This might sound funny, but pick a topic and start debating both sides in your mind. This exercise will improve your ability to think critically and articulate your thoughts in English.

#### 10\. Embrace Corrections

Ask your friends to correct you whenever you make a mistake. It may be frustrating at the moment, but that frustration will ensure the mistake sticks with you forever. Also, never be satisfied with your first draft---keep refining it until you're happy with the result.

#### 11\. Engage on Twitter

Start tweeting! The character limit forces you to be concise and clear, which is great practice for improving your writing skills over time.

#### 12\. Avoid Literal Translations

Don't translate your thoughts directly from your mother tongue to English. This often results in awkward phrasing. For example, instead of saying, "You have the tickets?" say, "Do you have the tickets?" Also, avoid using local language slang in your English conversations.

#### 13\. Expand Your Vocabulary

Try using alternative words for commonly used terms. Instead of saying "OK" repeatedly, mix it up with "Alright" or "Sure."

#### 14\. Avoid Repetition

Repeating the same word over and over again shows a limited vocabulary and weakens your point. Make an effort to vary your language.

#### 15\. Welcome Feedback

Be open to corrections. I invite readers to point out any mistakes in this post by leaving a comment below. It's a great way to learn and improve.

#### 16\. Avoid Spelling Mistakes

Take care to avoid spelling mistakes. This not only builds discipline but also enhances your credibility, especially in professional settings.

### Bonus: How to Search for Definitions on Google

Whenever you encounter a new word, simply type `define:<word>` in Google. For example, `define:contrafibularity`.

### Final Thoughts

Improving your English is a continuous journey. By incorporating these tips into your daily routine, you'll see noticeable improvements in both your written and spoken skills. Remember, practice makes perfect!

<em>This post is drawn from personal experience.</em>

Over the past 5 years, I have seen a radical improvement in my English skills. My English is not perfect, and you can even point out grammatical mistakes in this blog post. However, my tips will give you confidence and drastically reduce errors. 

When I was growing up, I was adviced to read books to improve my English and vocabulary. But I wasn't comfortable reading books. They are still one of the best ways to improve your English, however, I want to suggest few other exercises which you can do to improve your written &amp; spoken skills, while keeping yourself entertained and gaining knowledge at the same time.

<ul>

	<li><strong>Watch American &amp; British TV shows</strong> (sitcoms and drama). I'll suggest a few below. Start watching initially with subtitles, and slowly stop using them. Whenever you encounter a new word, pause the video, search the meaning and then resume watching</li>

	<li><strong>Read blog posts</strong>. Lots and lots of blog posts. Pick any topic (eg. Technology) and start reading</li>

	<li><strong>Read Wikipedia articles</strong>. Make it a point to read at least one long article per day</li>

	<li><strong>Start a blog</strong> and ask your friend who is better at English to correct you. Also proof read your blog post 3-4 times after publishing</li>

	<li><strong>Start thinking in English</strong> instead of your mother tongue</li>

	<li>Try using complicated ways for explaining simple things</li>

	<li><strong>STOP using SMS lingo</strong>. Write sentences properly. This way you can also improve your typing skills.</li>

	<li>If you encounter a new word, search for the definition immediately and try to use that new word at least 3 times in that day (tip by <a href="http://kirstenuncensored.wordpress.com" target="_blank">Kirsten</a>)</li>

	<li><strong>Argue with yourself.</strong> This may sound funny; pick a topic and start thinking about points which favor it and are also against it. This helps develop your ability to debate and argue</li>

	<li><strong>Keeping correcting yourself. </strong>I begged my friends to correct me whenever I used to go wrong. The best way your mistakes can get corrected is when you are at the verge of making a point in a serious discussion and your friend interrupts you just to correct your grammar. That frustration will correct your mistake forever. Another way to correct yourself is by never getting satisfied with what you have written so far, like this post, where I have replaced words above 10 times before I reached till this point</li>

	<li><strong>Start using Twitter.</strong> Start tweeting and over a period of time, your writing skill will improve</li>

	<li><strong>STOP using SMS lingo</strong>. I can't stress this enough</li>

	<li><strong>Don't force an accent.</strong> Don't try to fake American or British accent.</li>

	<li><strong>Don't literally translate your local language to English</strong>. People tend to translate their mother tongue to English and most of the times it sounds funny and is equally humiliating. Eg. "You have the tickets?" should be, "Do you have the tickets?" At the same time, stop using local language slangs (like Bob, Raa, Daa, Yaar, etc.). </li>

	<li><strong>Try to use alternate words for most commonly used words</strong>. Eg. instead of repeatedly saying "OK", say "Alright".</li>

	<li><strong>Don't repeat the same word over and over again. </strong>It shows your weakness in English and the subject you are talking about.</li>

	<li><strong>Welcome corrections</strong>. In this instance, I welcome the readers to correct my mistakes in this post by leaving a comment</li>

	<li><strong>Avoid spelling </strong><strong>mistakes</strong>. This will help build the discipline and will also help you in your career</li>

</ul>
