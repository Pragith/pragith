<p>Highlights about this post :</p> <p>- Twitter<br /> - Facebook<br /> - College<br /> - Hairstyle<br /> - CCNA<br /> - Naruto<br /> - IBM's The Great Mind Challenge (TGMC)<br /> - Mozilla Campus Representative</p> <p>I'm back on Twitter, thanks to <a href="http://tweetdeck.com/" target="_blank">TweetDeck</a>! It's an Adobe AIR application, which helps you to post on multiple <a href="http://twitter.pragith.net/" target="_blank"><strong>Twitter</strong></a> accounts, and Facebook account.</p> <p><strong>Catch me on Twitter :-</strong></p> <p><a href="http://twitter.com/PragithP"><img src="http://twitsig.com/PragithP.jpg" alt="" /></a></p> <p>And that brings us to <a href="http://facebook.com/crabbie" target="_blank"><strong>Facebook</strong></a>. I must confess that I was very much intimidated with it's interface long back, and hence had de-activated my account. But, TweetDeck helped me overcome this, and now, I'm even more "social" (though I still loathe the stupid quizzes). Few of my school &amp; college friends have also joined Facebook, and are using their "REAL" names (unlike Orkut).</p> <p>And that brings us to College. I'm currently in the middle of 5th semester, and expecting the main exams to get over by 24th December 2009. Also hoping for Campus Placements this semester or the next one. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">I might carry on with my current hairstyle for the interviews too.</span></p> <p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">And that brings us to Hairstyle. I've not trimmed my hair since mid of July, and I prefer to keep the reasons for the same with myself.</span></p> <p><span style="color: #e95e01;"><strong>Update : Got a haircut</strong></span></p> <p>No, that doesn't lead us to <strong><a href="http://www.cisco.com/web/learning/le3/le2/le0/le9/learning_certification_type_home.html" target="_blank">CCNA</a></strong>, but I'm going to talk about it anyway.<br /> I started studying for CCNA a couple of weeks ago. I've finished ICND 1, and half-way through ICND 2. It's really really interesting and I created my own lab with 2 Routers and 1 Cloud.</p> <p>I've configured "Akatsuki" router properly, and it can connect/ping/traceroute to Internet. I used Microsoft's LoopBack adapter and shared the Internet connection from the Wireless LAN.</p> <p>Here is the layout :</p> <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-272" title="CCNA Lab" src="http://pragith.net/blog/wp-content/capture.jpg" alt="CCNA Lab" width="612" height="350" /></p> <p>You might have noticed weird names for the routers, and that brings us to the next topic, <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naruto" target="_blank">Naruto</a></strong>.<br /> I'm currently hooked onto an Anime ("cartoon" for those people who don't understand and don't want to understand different forms of cartoons) named "Naruto". I started with Anime, and I liked it so much that I even started reading it's Manga ("comic" in Japanese).</p> <p>I'm also engaged in a project making competition organized by IBM known as<strong> <a href="http://tgmc.in" target="_blank">The Great Mind Challenge</a></strong> (TGMC). It's mainly a Java based project, which involves Project Planning, Modeling, Coding and Documenting the software. Me, along with 3 of my classmates, are doing <a href="https://tgmc.in/project_scenario_view.php?page=1&amp;id=4">Online Library Management System</a> under the team name - <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Blue</span><span style="color: #999999;">Shadow</span></strong> (cool haan?)</p> <p>And the last topic for this post. My friend <a href="http://webecho.co.cc" target="_blank">Vikram</a> introduced me to "Mozilla Campus Representative" program from Mozilla (duh!). It's about promoting and bringing awareness about "The Open Web" and "<strong><a href="http://getfirefox.com/" target="_blank">Firefox</a></strong>" in your college. How do we do that?  Well, Mozilla gives us something known as a "Swag Pack", which is better explained here -&gt; http://www.thechetan.com/2009/09/now-i-am-mozilla-campus-representative/</p> <p>So, that's the end of my 1st ever, fully linked, highly educative update. See ya after an year or so. I'm so damn tired!<br /> (Psst...Try to decrypt the title of this blog post ;)</p>
